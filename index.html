    <p>George Lucas thought that the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantina made Han look cold blooded. Let`s  think about the original Scen shall we? Greedo the bouty hunter is holding Han at gunpont and says in his gurgly voice he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow han a new smuggling hatch. That makes han <em>cool</em>,not cold. </p>
